Introduction
========
Rseg is a Chinese Word Segmentation(中文分词) routine in pure Ruby.

The algorithm is based on this article: http://xiecc.blog.163.com/blog/static/14032200671110224190/

Usage
========

It's very easy to use:

> require 'rubygems'
> require 'rseg'
> RSeg.segment("需要分词的文章")
['需要', '分词', '的', '文章']

The first call to Rseg#segment will need about 30 seconds to load the dictionary, the second call will be very fast.

Performance
========
About 5M character/s on my Macbook (Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz/4G mem).
